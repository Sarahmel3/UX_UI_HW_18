            <p> Hello, I'm Sarah. I am a UX/UI Designer with a big heart and even bigger goals. I thrive when given tasks and always aim to exceed expectations. Making people happy is my main goal in life, whether it be personal or professional. I have a background in Journalism and hope to one day publish a book of my own. Some of my experience includes Responsive Web Design, Mobile Applications, and Graphic Design - as well as owning an Etsy store where I sell my personal designs as stickers or prints.</p>

            <p> Botani was a Case Study that I did with a group while in School at Denver University. The goal of this project was to create an application that would help plant owners - new or experienced - keep their leafy friends alive, at ease. This application included features like taking a photo of a problem area on a plant to identify the issue and provide information to solve it, or scheduling watering/care times for notifications to keep the user on top of care. </p></div>

            <p> Assigned with the task of redesigning a non-profit, my team decided on the Colorado Beagle Rescue. With the hope of helping this organization find homes for more dogs than they did before, we took on the task of completely flipping the design and making it responsive across all formats. </p>
